  <body>
    <p>I live in Adelaide in South Australia and I work at the South
    Australia Museum. Nothing here will be related to my work
    there.</p>
    <p>This site is mostly for my own reference, to the extent that
    there will be no analytics installed on this.</p>
    <p>If you want to contact me I can be reached at:
