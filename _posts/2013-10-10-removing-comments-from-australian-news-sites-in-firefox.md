# Removing comments from Australian News sites in Firefox

If, like me, you find the presence of comments on news websites irritating [this](http://userstyles.org/styles/91054/remove-comments-on-australian-news-sites) might appeal to you. 

It's a userstyle for the Firefox addon [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) which removes the comments from a list of Australian news web sites. I've also tried to get it to remove elements that refer to the presence of comments - those little balloons with numbers in them and that type of thing.

To use it first install [Stylish](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/). Then go the the page for the userstyle on [userstyles.org](http://userstyles.org/styles/91054/remove-comments-on-australian-news-sites) and click on the **Install with Stylish** button.

The sites which will be affected will appear in a list after you clink on the Install button but if you want to look through the rules before installing it click on *Show CSS*. 

You'll see that rather than do a general rule to get rid of anything that might be a comment on any page I've added particular rules for each individual site. I don't necessarily think that comments on web sites are a bad thing so I'd rather have them appear as the default and choose when they go away. You could also get rid of the comments using [adblock plus](http://adblockplus.org/) but I wanted the presence or absence of ads to be a separate decision to the presence or absence of comments.

Getting it to work on Chrome as well would have required too much maintenance and I mostly use Firefox myself so that's what I've gone with.

It will be updated as and when either I look at a news site I've not looked at before or a site changes or a site which has good comments turns into a site with stupid comments.
