Since its launch I've found [The Global Mail](http://www.theglobalmail.org/) to be a consistently interesting read. Their new website is a vast improvement over the previous one but I still prefer reading it in an ebook format.  For this I use [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/)

So super early on Saturday morning I get Calibre to download the Global Mail (and a bunch of other sites) and convert them into ebooks and put them onto my ereader so that I can read them at my leisure through the week.  It feels like the old tradition of sitting down and wading through the sunday papers.  

I just did this with the basic recipe creation using the various rss feeds, but this will save you the hassle of tracking down the various feed urls. I've set it to remove the comments, remove the block quotes and also make the picture captions little and italic.

In Calibre paste [the recipe](/downloads/code/global_mail.recipe) into **Fetch news > add a custom news source**. Click **Switch to Advanced mode** then paste this over what's already in there. Alternatively download it and then from **add a custom news source** choose **Load recipe from file**

Then click **Add/Update recipe** and then, once it appears in the "Available user recipes", choose it and then either schedule when it should download or do an immediate test download to make sure it works.  I always do a test download first just to make sure.

When you're done click the close button.  When it asks if you're sure choose "yes" - if it appears in the list of available recipes means that it's saved.

I'll update this as necessary as the site changes.
