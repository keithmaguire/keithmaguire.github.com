When doing historical research in Australia going back more than a few decades it can be difficult to progress without knowing the different cadastral boundaries associated with the area. Once you know them it can help guide you towards the appropriate next resource.

If you're looking in Victoria you'll want to know the parish and county. This is how to work that out.

There's two ways to work this out -- either using historical sources  or using current online mapping technologies. Online maps can be a nice and quick way to do this. 

Here's how to find the boundaries of different historical cadastral regions when you're working from the address as people understand it today:

This is all relying the assumption that the boundaries of parishes and hundreds haven't changed over time. This is on the whole a safe assumption, the most variety I've seen when researching how the shape of a number of parishes changed over the course of a century or so was the addition or removal of an area of land adding up to a few square miles. But if your area of interest ends up being near a border bear it in mind and record the names of the parishes or hundreds which join onto the one you're looking at.

Over the history of Victoria there have been a number of [maps](http://handle.slv.vic.gov.au/10381/119930) printed for exactly this purpose, so that is one way to search.

But it's quicker and easier to go to Land.vic.gov.au and use the online maps there. The number of steps might seem a bit excessive but once you've done it one time it only takes a few seconds in future.


1 On [Land.vic.gov.au](http://www.land.vic.gov.au/) go to [Land & Survey Spatial info.](http://www.land.vic.gov.au/home/go-to-links/land-and-survey-spatial-info)

![select Land and Survey Spatial Info](/images/viccad/Selection_005.png )

2 In bottom left of the screen, enter your suburb or town or locality into the **Suburb/ Town/ Locality** box and press enter

![enter suburb](/images/viccad/Selection_001.png )

3 Depending on your locality name you may have to choose from similar sounding places - choose the one that is appropriate and click **next**

4 This will bring up a map with the area you searched for and lots of other bits of information

5 Click on **Build map** at the top left of the screen

6 Click in all the boxes that have ticks to remove the ticks and unselect everything

7 Click in the box beside **Parish/Township** to select it

8 Click on the **Refresh Map** button

9 The map will now, in dotted green lines, change to show you the outline of the parish or parishes which covered the area you were interested in.  The name of the parish will be in small green text. There may also be some townships - indicated by the name followed with "TP"

So in this example you can see that the area currently covered by the area Echuca previously covered the parishes of Echuca North, Wharparilla, Millewa, Echuca South, Kanyapella and Koyunga.  It also contains Echuca and Echuca West Townships

Historical Parish maps can be found online at the [State Library of Victoria](http://slv.vic.gov.au), the [PROV](http://prov.vic.gov.au) or the [NLA](http://trove.nla.gov.au/map).

This map with no extra features is the easiest one to see the outlines of the parishes but if you need a bit more details to orient yourself then click on whichever details you want to add back into the map - I find it most useful to turn on Roads.

![select roads]( /images/viccad/Selection_007.png)

(Sometimes Roads just adds the road names, if that happens then Roads (Centrelines) will draw the line of the road in too.)


If you also need to find the name of the county the easiest and quickest option is to just cheat by searching Google for the parish name and "in the county of" and it'll find a map title from somewhere.
