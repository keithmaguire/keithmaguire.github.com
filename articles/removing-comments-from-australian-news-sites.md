# Removing comments from Australian News sites

If, like me, you find the presence of comments on news websites irritating [this](http://userstyles.org/styles/91054/remove-comments-on-australian-news-sites) might appeal to you. 

It's a userstyle for the browser addon Stylish which will remove the comments from a bunch of Australian news web sites. I've also tried to get it to remove elements that refer to the presence of comments - those little balloons with numbers in them and that type of thing.

To use it first install Stylish [for Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/stylish/) or [for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylish/fjnbnpbmkenffdnngjfgmeleoegfcffe?hl=en) . Then go to the the page for the userstyle on [userstyles.org](http://userstyles.org/styles/91054/remove-comments-on-australian-news-sites) and click on the **Install with Stylish** button.

The sites which will be affected by the script will appear in a list after you clink on the Install button.

If you want to look through the rules before installing click on **Show CSS**. You'll see that rather than do a general rule to get rid of anything that might be a comment on any page I've added particular rules for each individual site (or group of sites if they're all working with the same structure).

I don't think that comments on web sites are necessarily a bad thing - just because they're unbearable on news sites at the moment doesn't mean that they're useless elsewhere - so I'd rather have them appear as the default and choose on an individual basis when they go away. 

The usrscript will be updated as and when either I look at a news site I've not looked at before or a site changes or a site which has good comments turns into a site with stupid comments.
