Hello
# Me

I'm Keith Maguire. I'm originally from Ireland but came to Australia about a decade ago. I work at the South Australian Museum, primarily on their Collections Management Software, KE EMu. Prior to working here I worked at the State Library of Victoria as a Librarian.


## Made with
This blog is made with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). I like the concept of static website generators because wrestling with them seems more entertaining than working out how to work a wordpress or blogger or suchlike site or installation.

The dates of posts are when they were _first_ written. I'll update or remove things as appropriate. If for some reason you want to see the more worser version of things look at this site on the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/*/keithmaguire.net).

All opinions are mine.
