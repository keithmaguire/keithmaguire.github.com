Hello
# Me

I'm Keith Maguire. I'm originally from Ireland but emigrated to Australia in 2003. I work at the South Australian Museum, primarily on their Collections Management Software, KE EMu. Prior to working here I worked at the State Library of Victoria as a Librarian.


## Made with
This blog is made with [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted on Github. 

I'll update or remove things as appropriate. If for some reason you want to see a prior version of this site look on the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/*/keithmaguire.net).

All opinions are mine.
